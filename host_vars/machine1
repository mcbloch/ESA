# This metal server will define the containers hosted on it

# lxc_containers:
#   simple-web-01:
#     distro: debian
#     release: buster
#     arch: amd64
#     store: dir
#     ip4: 0.0.0.0 # Will be filled in by the lxc role
#   ruby-web-01:
#     ip4: 0.0.0.0
# port_forwards:
#   - host_port: 8321

#     container_name: ruby-web-01

# What do we have?
#    - a machine (M) with ssh access
#    - a playbook to deploy an application (A) to a group of hosts (G)

# Flow atm
#  add container with name (C) to metal (M) config
#  M creates container C
#  manually add C to ssh.config with jump through M
#  manually add C to group G in inventory.ini
#  define and run a playbook on


# Group types
# - application: these have to be defined in advance and by the user
#                these have a playbook written by the user
#                will have a unique container assigned by default if not specified
#                at the moment only can be put in one container
# - container: these can be defined by the user.
#              these can have multiple applications
#              container is assigned in the application
# - metal: these have to be defined by the user
#          these host containers
#          containers will specify the metal they are installed on
